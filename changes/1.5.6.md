# KordEx 1.5.6

This release targets Kord `0.8.0`, the latest stable release for Kord. It's been over a year since the previous stable
Kord release, so it's also been a year since the previous stable KordEx release. How time flies, right?

Please note that as of this release, the `develop` branch is going away. Please reparent your PRs to target the `root`
branch.

**A note about Maven repos:**

Please be aware that as of this release, KordEx is now being deployed to these Maven servers:

* **Releases:** Maven Central
* **Snapshots:** Sonatype Snapshots (`https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots`)

KordEx releases will no longer be published to the Kotlin Discord maven repo.

**Highlights of this release:**

* We now use Kotlin 1.8.0, and you should too
* Support for Modal forms has been added, which function similarly to argument classes, and can be provided to your
  commands and components in the same way - [see here for an example](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/blob/root/test-bot/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlindiscord/kord/extensions/testbot/extensions/ModalTestExtension.kt)
* KordEx is now capable of intercepting unknown Kord events and submitting its own events in their place - initially,
  this just includes the experimental member screening events available on a handful of servers, but PRs will be
  accepted for other event types that Kord doesn't plan on supporting
* A data adapter and storage unit system has been added, allowing extensions to more easily store data, with the
  ability for individual bots to define how that data should be stored - note, however, that this is an early version
  of that system, and it will likely be changed significantly later
* A module, `extra-pluralkit`, has been created to make things easier for bots that wish to support PluralKit, a very
  common accessibility tool on Discord that's mainly used by plural systems
* Additional checks have been added that allow you to test for NSFW channels and guild NSFW levels, among other things
* A cache map object with an extra typed API has been added, allowing you to cache data between checks and make use
  of it in the body of your commands, as well as cache data between task runs and provide extra event context for 
  Kord events
* Commands were given their own translation bundles, which fall back to their extension's if missing
* Slash commands may be fully localized
* Many misc utils have been added, and fixes and additions have been made for existing utils
* Individual converts have been updated with new features and fixes
* The test bot has been moved to its own module, which makes it easier to look over and modify

As always, if you run into any problems, please let us know!
