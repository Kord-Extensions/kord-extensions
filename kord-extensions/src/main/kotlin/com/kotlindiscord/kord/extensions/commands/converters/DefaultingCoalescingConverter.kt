/**
 * Abstract base class for a defaulting coalescing converter.
 *
 * Coalescing converters take a list of multiple arguments, and consumes as many arguments as it can, combining
 * those arguments into a single value. Upon reaching an argument that can't be consumed, the converter stores
 * its final result and tells the parser how many arguments it managed to consume. The parser will continue
 * processing the unused arguments, passing them to the remaining converters.
 *
 * A defaulting coalescing converter has a default value that will be provided if nothing could be parsed.
 *
 * You can create an optional coalescing converter of your own by extending this class.
 *
 * @property validator Validation lambda, which may throw a [CommandException] if required.
