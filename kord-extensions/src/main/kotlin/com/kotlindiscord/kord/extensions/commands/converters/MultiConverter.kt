 * Abstract base class for a multi converter.
 *
 * Multi converters take a list of multiple arguments, consuming as many arguments as it can to produce a list
 * of resulting values. Upon reaching an argument that can't be consumed, the converter stores everything it could
 * convert and tells the parser how many arguments it managed to consume. The parser will continue processing the
 * unused arguments, passing them to the remaining converters.
 *
 * You can create a multi converter of your own by extending this class.
 *
 * @property validator Validation lambda, which may throw a [CommandException] if required.
