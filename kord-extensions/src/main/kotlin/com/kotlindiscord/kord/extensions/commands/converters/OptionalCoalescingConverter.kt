/**
 * Abstract base class for an optional coalescing converter.
 *
 * Coalescing converters take a list of multiple arguments, and consumes as many arguments as it can, combining
 * those arguments into a single value. Upon reaching an argument that can't be consumed, the converter stores
 * its final result and tells the parser how many arguments it managed to consume. The parser will continue
 * processing the unused arguments, passing them to the remaining converters.
 *
 * An optional coalescing converter has a nullable type - you'll get `null` from it if nothing could be parsed.
 *
 * You can create an optional coalescing converter of your own by extending this class.
 *
 * @property outputError Whether the argument parser should output parsing errors on invalid arguments.
 * @property validator Validation lambda, which may throw a DiscordRelayedException if required.
