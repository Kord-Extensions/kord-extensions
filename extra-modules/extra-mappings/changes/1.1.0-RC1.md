# Mappings Extension: 1.1.0-RC1

Changes since 1.0.0-RC4:

* Update to KordEx RC6.
* Update to Linkie 1.0.58, which makes Legacy Yarn its own namespace (`legacy-yarn`) instead of a Yarn channel - this means that it's now configured separately and has its own commands.
* Allow bot admins to configure extra Yarn channels, allowing them to disable Patchwork.

For more information on the newly-configurable settings, please see [the README](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/ext-mappings#configuration).
