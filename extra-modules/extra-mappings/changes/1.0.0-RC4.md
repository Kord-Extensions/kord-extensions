# Mappings Extension: 1.0.0-RC4

Changes since 1.0.0-RC3:

* Add a configurable paginator timeout, defaulting to 300 seconds (5 minutes), which should prevent your bot from running out of memory after a while. See [the README](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/ext-mappings#configuration) for more information on how to configure it.
