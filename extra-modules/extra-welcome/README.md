# Welcome Channel Module

This module used to belong to [the Cozy Discord bot project](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord), but the
original maintainers have [given their permission](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord/issues/84) to move it here.

We'll write documentation for [the site](https://docs.kordex.dev) later.
In the meantime, we've provided the original README below.

---

This module allows you to easily maintain and update a bot-managed channel (for example, a welcome or rules channel)
based on a YAML file that you change whenever you need to update it. It also supports dynamic blocks with content that
can change over time, and will attempt to only update messages that havenâ€™t changed.

For more information on how to use this as a
user, [please see this guide on Notion](https://flicker-report-d77.notion.site/Welcome-Channel-Spec-e091676daa4b48b9996c66aaab540fff?pvs=4).
