# Common Extensions: v1.0.0-RC1

This is the initial release for this extension. It contains the following:

* A configurable extension that keeps track of emojis the bot can make use of, and allows extensions to get at them
  easily
* Abstract classes for toml-backed configuration and json-backed serialised data, for use by other extensions
* A way for other extensions to add common modules without requiring the user to configure them - may need further
  thinking about though

This is a new module and there will be teething issues. If you have use-cases that this module would help with, please
test it out and let us know how you get on!
