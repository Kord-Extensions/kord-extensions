/**
 * Mark the class as a converter class, allowing converter builders and their functions to be generated.
 *
 * @property names Converter names, used to generate the functions. Multiple names will generate multiple sets of
 * functions - surprise surprise.

 * @property types Converter types to generate builders and functions for.
 * @property imports Extra imports required for generated code to be valid.
 *
 * @property builderConstructorArguments Arguments to add to the builder's constructor, if any. Prefix with "!!" to
 * stop the argument from being passed into the converter.
 *
 * @property builderGeneric Generic typevar that the builder should take, if any.
 * @property builderFields Extra fields to add to the builder, if any. Use `lateinit var` for required values.
 * @property builderInitStatements Extra lines of code to add to the builder's `init { }` block.
 * @property builderExtraStatements Extra lines of code to add to the builder, after the fields.
 * @property builderSuffixedWhere Extra generic bounds to place after `where` in the builder's signature.
 *
 * @property functionBuilderArguments Arguments to pass into the builder's constructor, if any.
 * @property functionGeneric Generic typevar that the builder should take, if any. Will be `reified`.
 * @property functionSuffixedWhere Extra generic bounds to place after `where` in the function's signature.
