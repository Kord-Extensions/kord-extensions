# About

Modules are separate projects that add functionality to Kord Extensions. There are several types of module:

* First-party modules: Built alongside Kord Extensions and use the same versioning
* Extra modules: Maintained alongside Kord Extensions, but have their own versioning - these are prefixed with `Extra:` here
* Third-party modules: Maintained outside the Kord Extensions organisation - these are not documented here

Modules may provide anything, although additional converters for your command logic and fully-implemented extensions
are the most common things to include.
