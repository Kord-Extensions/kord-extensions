# About

Modules are separate projects that add functionality to Kord Extensions. Official modules are built alongside Kord 
Extensions and use the same versioning scheme - simply match the version of the module to the version of Kord 
Extensions you're using.

Modules may provide anything, although additional converters for your command logic and fully-implemented extensions
are the most common things to include.
