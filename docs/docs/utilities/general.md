# General

To make your life easier, Kord Extensions contains a number of utilities. These utilities have been categorized by
type, to make things easier to find.

??? question "Why not PR these to Kord?"
    At its core, Kord is a protocol library and caching implementation. It's designed to follow Discord's API spec
    as close as it can and, while it does provide many niceties, not every utility makes sense to include directly
    within Kord.

    If you feel like that's not the way things should be, please have a chat with the Kord team - we're always working
    with them and we'll happily share whatever utilities they feel should be upstream!

## Attachments

Function                      | Description
:---------------------------- | :----------
`Attachment.download`         | Downloads the attachment to a `ByteBuffer` and returns it - note that this will load the entire file into memory, so you should use one of the other functions if you just want to write it to a file
`Attachment.downloadToFile`   | Downloads the attachment to the given file, returning the corresponding [Path] object
`Attachment.downloadToFolder` | Downloads the attachment to a file within the given directory, returning the corresponding [Path] object

## Channels

Function        | Description
:-------------- | :----------
`ensureWebhook` | Ensures that a webhook with the given parameters exists in a channel, and returns it for use

## Deltas

Kord itself doesn't contain any real way to compare two events or objects, so Kord Extensions includes some deltas
you can use to find the difference between certain objects.

* `UserDelta` for comparing two base `User` objects
* `MemberDelta` for comparing two guild `Member` objects
* `MessageDelta` for comparing two `Message` objects
* `RoleDelta` for comparing the roles between two guild `Member` objects

In all cases, you should use the static `from` function to create a delta object. All properties on delta objects are
Kord `Optional`s - they'll be set to `Optional.Missing` if there was no change between the two objects, otherwise
they'll contain the **newly changed** value.

If the `from` function returns `null`, then the `old` object you passed as the first parameter is also `null`. You'll
also get `null` from `RoleDelta.from()` if there were no changes.

## Environment

`env`     | Get the value for an environmental variable (if it exists), attempting to load from a `.env` file in the current working directory first.

:----------- | :----------
`getKoin`    | For situations where you can't inherit the `KoinComponent` interface (for example, in a top-level function), you can use this function to get the current Koin instance.
`loadModule` | Wrapper around Koin's `module` DSL function that immediately registers the module against the current Koin instance.
